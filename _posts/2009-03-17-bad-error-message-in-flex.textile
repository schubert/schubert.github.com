title: Bad Error Message (In Flex)

Had some flex code that generated the following compile-time error:

<pre>
<code>
1061: Call to a possibly undefined method fooBar through a reference with static type mx.controls.VideoDisplay.
</code>
</pre>

Already I have a problem with this. If the message is “possibly undefined” then I would expect it to be a warning that an exception *may* occur at runtime if indeed the message does not exist (you see the same thing in Obj-C if you don’t declare a method in your header but that is done correctly).

With this confusion in mind I run off to see why this is a compile-time error and found this "here":http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/compilerErrors.html

bq. You are calling a method that is not defined.

… … in what sense then is it “possibly” undefined?
